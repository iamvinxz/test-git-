                    <p>Welcome to my website, my friend. I am John Khervin Dela Cruz and currently taking a degree of Diploma in Information Technology. I am 20 years old and my birthday is on October 13 2004. I am currently living in Provident, Marikina City. I love playing online games, watching anime series, and above all, I love playing instrument. I play guitar in our church and it is very fun. Coding is also one of my hobbies. I know several computer languages such as Java, C, C++, and JavaScript, I also have an experience using HTML5 and CSS. My current goal now is to understand and to learn how to use frameworks that can help me to improve my skill set in developing a system or website since it is my dream job - I want to become a full stack website developer. Now let me tour you in my website!</p>

                        <p>Education is essential for every individual since it is something that you can use in order to compete and survive in this world. For my background I am a second year student in Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Sta. Mesa, Manila. I took my secondary education in Sta. Elena High School, where I learned and enhanced my musical skills. For my primary, I took it in Leodegario Victorino Elementary School. <p>

                    <h3 class="exp-header">Experiences</h3>
                    <p>In my 20 years of my existence, I am not that exposed to any kind of situations or organizations where I can develop my skills. I am just learning on my own in my house to code and build some small projects for school. Watching tutorials, and sometimes I ask my churchmate who happened to be a web developer for tips and techniques that I can apply for my projects. I have a work experience as an English Teacher for Japanese student but it is not relevant in my course. I took a TESDA Training in Computer Servicing and Programming in Java that somehow help me to improve and elevate my skills.</p>
